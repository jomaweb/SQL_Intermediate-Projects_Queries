## Description
This repository contains a selection of SQL queries to retrieve and analyze information from the *1999 Czech Financial Database*, a real anonymized database of Bank Transactions, and the *Sakila Sample Database* from a Movie Rental Store.

If you landed here by accident or because you are interested in SQL, you can also use the material in this repository to refresh your knowledge and the syntax of SQL. The SQL statements documented here are related to the following topics:  *Functions, DateTime, Data Cleaning, Operators, Main clauses, Aggregations, Window Functions, Rank, Joins, Joins on Multiple Temporary Tables and Cross and Self-Joins*. You can also find here some SQL cheat sheet that clearly synthesized the syntax of the queries.
